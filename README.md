## Securing-cloud-data-under-keyexposure
A web based application to provide more security for data 
## About
One significant difficulty stem from the fact that many services rely significantly on
encryption technologies to protect the secrecy of sensitive information. Encryption, 
a critical technology in cybersecurity, converts plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext, allegedly protecting it from unauthorized access. However, the effectiveness of 
encryption is dependent on the security of the related keying material. Surprisingly, 
the aforementioned monitoring program obtained this keying material by illegal
ways such as backdoors, bribes, or coercion.

## Result
ddressed the problem of securing data outsourced to the cloud against an adversary whichhas
access to the encryption key. For that purpose, we introduced a novel security definition that
captures data confidentiality against the new adversary. We then proposed Bastion, a scheme
which ensures the confidentiality of encrypted data even when the adversary has the encryption
key, and all but two ciphertext blocks. Bastion is most suitable for settings where the ciphertext
blocks are stored in multi-cloud storage systems. In these settings, the adversarywould need to
acquire the encryption key, and to compromise all servers, in order to recover any single block
of plaintext.
